b102
- Changed how QMobs aquire their weapons from QBow, to harden against the possibility of them not getting ANY weapons.
- Did various internal optimizations [IN PROGRESS]

b101d
- Fixed the block break event being accidentally send for the client when hitting things with projectiles.
- Possibly fixed the Seedling not breaking upon running out of ammo.

b101c
- Fixed a potential recipe crash (I was accidentally trying to access crafting inventory slot 10, which some mods don't harden against.)

b101b
- Fixed a server/client NPE crash. Hrm.

b101
- Fixed the Seedling being crafted with 0 ammunition.
- Added the "TARGET FLYING" command for the Arms Assistant. Keep your feet firmly planted on the ground.
- Adjusted the tooltip of the Thorn Spitter to reflect its ammo usage. (A thorn magazine, not 8 thorn bundles)
- Added some more explosion protection for Dragonbox rockets and the powder knuckles. They can now be set via config whether they damage terrain or not.
- Added some general block breaking protection for the remaining weapons that break things. They now send a proper BlockBreak event (which can be disabled in the config for pvp purposes).
- Fixed the Four-headed Dragonbox looking like it's cooling down despite being empty.
- Visually speaking you should now hold your weapon up when you fire it. Hopefully.
- Added a config option for the (Modified) Coin- and Potatosser to not drop anything on missed shots
- The Nether Bellows now won't create fire if doFireTick is turned off.


b100
- Fixed hostile mobs and bosses not being targetable by the Arms Assistant's black-/whitelist
- Adjusted the default cooldown speed for the Improved Auto-Crossbow from 4 to 8 ticks. 4 was a bit TOO fast for arrows. (They tend to bounce off.)
- Changed the sprites for the Bow with Quiver and the Ender Bow, so they don't look like the vanilla bow anymore

b99
- Fixed the empty Improved Auto-Crossbow icon not having the proper capitalization.
- Fixed the Proximity Thorn Thrower and Improved Auto-Crossbow models not looking for the right texture size.

b98
- Allowed the AA to reload the Soul Cairn
- Fixed the Potatosser not accepting charcoal (I had to use the ore dictionary wildcard value for itemstacks. Silly stuff.)
- Fixed a server crash by not using MathHelper.truncateDoubleToInt() for the Arms Assistant. Turns out that function is client-side only for some reason.
- Added the Hidden Ender Pistol
- Added the Improved Auto-Crossbow
- Added the Proximity Thorn Thrower (PTT)
- Did a couple code optimizations here and there, preparing for a major internal overhaul. (Assuming I ever aquire the time/muse for that.)
- Also adjusted a model array to be absolutely client-only, so BiomeTweaker doesn't try to crawl into it and crash. (Curse the damn confusing client/server divide or lack thereof...)

b97
- Hopefully fixed the LAST zoom-related bug now. (It'd zoom you in if someone next to you used the Ender Rifle's/Frost Lancer's scope. Turns out clients tick all players they know about, as
  little sense as that makes.)

b96
- Added config option to decide if any given weapon can be used by QuiverMobs individually
- Added "BLACKLIST" command to the Arms Assistant, to let them shoot ONLY at things named in the book
- Fixed QuiverMobs rapidly firing with the rocket launchers. (Turns out I wasn't setting a proper cooldown, since they're one-shot weapons in player hands. Which these bastards don't care
  about.)
- QuiverMobs should also now respect the mobGriefing gamerule when shooting at glass and other breakable things

b95
- Fixed packing up the Arms Assistant not saving the armor plating and communication upgrades.
- Adjusted the AA slightly, to not crawl at a snail's pace when told to STAY and being fully loaded up on armor and plating.
- Put a limit of 5 blocks on how many blocks the OWR's projectiles can punch through before running out of speed. Previously they were just going until they hit something unbreakable or
  alive.

b94
- Allowed the AA to reload the Potatosser (Doesn't require coal for now.)
- Fixed the AA only loading up one arrow on the Double Crossbow
- Added the Communication Upgrade to the Arms Assistant. (This lets it communicate with the owner and be aimed with the Targeting Helper.)
-> Added the Arms Assistant Targeting Helper. It's a handheld device that lets you manually aim AAs. Using this required the Communication Upgrade.
-> Added the "REMOTE FIRE" command. This will cause the AA to aim and shoot where you are pointing the Targeting Helper
-> Added the "HOLD FIRE" command to the AA. They will not shoot unless told to do so via the Targeting Helper.
-> Added the "TELL AMMO" command to the AA. Only relevant with the Communication Upgrade. It'll tell the owner when it has run out of ammunition.
-> Added the "TELL HEALTH" command, same conditions as above. It tells the owner when this thing's health is below 30%.
-> Added the "TELL DEATH" command, also the same as above. Tells the owner when an AA was destroyed.
- Added the Heavy Plating upgrade to the AA. This provides 50% knockback resistance and 3 damage reduction vs anything blockable, at the cost of 50% speed
- Added the "SAFETY RANGE" command, (communications-unrelated). This will cause the AA to at least try to not get hurt by its own explosives.
- Changed the ability to fire the AAs weapons while riding them and tied it to the Targeting Helper instead.
- The AA will also now no longer attack players in creative mode. (No point in doing so.)
- I also hooked into some forge events for block breaking, so protection plugins can actually do something about it.
- Adjusted the Ray of Hope reloading recipe to not create 1,8k recipe permutations. Makes it a little easier on NEI. :P

b93
- Fixed the AA not remembering how to use the contents of its first rail.
- Fixed the Four-Headed Dragonbox only reloading 2 rockets per bundle, instead of 8
- Fixed the Snow Cannon eating 4 blocks of snow with every shot, instead of just 1
- Fixed the Seed Sweeper model still having a jar on it, even when empty
- Fixed reloading with magazines not working. (That snuck in in the last build, I think.)
- Fixed the Arms Assistant not accepting replacing empty magazines with fresh ones. Tch.
- Fixed the AA not properly deducting ammo from certain slots and ammo types. (Didn't update a bounds check to make use of the changed item storage.)
- Added a config option to the rocket launchers and the ERA to not damage terrain when in player hand
- Changed the Obsidian Splinter Pistol to split every splint in half (Something that was lost when it was changed to using magazines),
  giving it effectively double the ammunition again. (Dropping the magazine does mean some loss, though. Can't put back together what was split.)
- Added the Riding Upgrade to the Arms Assistant. You can now upgrade it with a saddle and ride it around (assuming it's mobile; It's gonna be a short ride without that.)
  By extension it will also fire its weapons if you attack with the QuiverBow weapon in the first slot of your hotbar
- Added the "STAGGER FIRE" command, which can be written into the book. It'll cause the AA to wait until the first rail is done with half its cooldown before firing the second rail.
  That should help with not wasting two shots on the same target

b92
- Fixed the Arms Assistant starting out with the second rail already attached. (Forgot to remove a debug line there.)
- Fixed the FrostLancer/EnderRifle zoom getting stuck when trying to give those to the AA on the second rail. Let's hope that this bug now goes the way of Herobrine

b91
- Made a whole bunch of adjustments and enhancements to the Arms Assistant
-> This includes a better targeting module (it's now able to see through glass and can fire with more accuracy at longer ranges)
	-> By extension I limited their firing range via config to 32 blocks. You can disable this at your own peril
	-> It does not yet lead targets, so circle strafing continues to work for now
-> They can also now hold onto any item. Whether or not they can use it is an entirely different question.
	-> Added a storage upgrade, which lets them hold 8 instead of 4 items
-> Added the ability to replace empty magazines by using a new magazine on them, to make reloading them easier
	-> Only happens if there's no space to add more items
-> Completed their leg design, making them capable of basic movement if upgraded
	-> The AA can be instructed to "STAY" (Will try to compensate for recoil) or "FOLLOW" (the owner) via the written book
-> They can also now be instructed to "TARGET FRIENDLY" and "INJURED ONLY". Use at your own risk
-> Speaking of risk: A second weapon rail has been added to enhance their fire power
-> Added the Arrow and Dragon Mortars to the list of items that can be reloaded
-> Fixed it using up items from players in creative mode
- Fixed the Auto-Crossbow not unchambering after firing

b90
- Fixed the Dragon and Arrow Mortars not adhering to their cooldown
- Fixed the Ray Of Hope accidentally being called Weapon Base by default (You'll need to manually fix that in your config if you already have one. Just delete the relevant line.)
- Also fixed the Dragon Mortar not consuming ammo
- Modified the Nether Bellows slightly to also burn down plants, instead of being stopped by it
- Added the Arms Assistant

b87
- Changed internally how weapons, ammunition and projectiles are named and registered, for some future (re)proofing.
  Turns out that having a running number can break things if you slide something into their middle ...same as with IDs in 1.6.4.
  So at some point I inadvertedly reverted back to an ID system of my own making without noticing. :|
  As an unfortunate side effect this will likely delete all existing gear due to name/reg mismatching when you load this up. Be prepared!
- Fixed the Nether Bellows not melting snow like it should. No idea when that broke.
- Fixed the Lapis Coil not inflicting Weakness. No idea when that broke either.
- Modified the Lapis Coil to use Lapis Magazines.
- Modified the Lightning Red to use Redstone Magazines.
- Modified the Redstone Sprayer to use Large Redstone Magazines.
- Modified the Nether Bellows to use Large Netherrack Magazines. This also obsoletes the need for coal as adhesive material.
  I removed Netherrack Bundles as extension of that. (No need for them anymore.)
- Fixed another bug in the ERA recipe. ._.  (I had a "Less Or Equal" instead of a "Greater Than" in there.)
- Added the Emerald Muzzle upgrade recipe to the Ender Rail Accelerator. That should ease the shockwave on firing.
  By extension this also means that I can now start adding upgrades to existing weapons if apropriate. :)

b86
- Reloading with magazines was seemingly asking for full weapons to reload, instead of empty ones. That has been fixed
- Also fixed being able to put full weapons into the reloading process, causing the already loaded magazine to be eaten

b85
- Hotfix: Recipes were broken; now they're (hopefully) not. Looks like I missed some checks and details here and there, causing those recipes to break all the things. >_>
- On the plus side: My understand of how Minecraft operates has been expanded by another critical part.

b84
- Fixed the ERA not burning out if it goes off in your pocket
- Did various internal code overhauls to clean things up and prepare a bunch of weapons to use magazines (Be on the lookout for all new bugs. >_> )
- Related, the Coin Tosser and Modified Coin Tosser now use Gold Magazines. (Which are filled with gold nuggets.)
- The Thorn Spitter also now uses Needle Magazines (Filled with cacti.)

b83
- Added the Ender Rail Accelerator
- Weapons should now keep their custom names when reloading

b82
- Made the weapon models in third person about 25% smaller
- Increased the default projectile speed of all crossbows by about 25% (Put some more perceived oomph behind them)
- Increased the default projectile speed of the Nether Bellows by about 50% (Might make it easier not to burn yourself with them)
- Increased the default damage of the Auto-Crossbow to be closer to that of the regular crossbows

b81
- Hotfix: Expanded the weapons array. Turns out that I now have more weapons and devices than I made room for initially. (40+)
- Also found out that the dev environment isn't caps sensitive, but regular Minecraft is, when it comes to textures. :|
- Fixed the Seed Sweeper not dropping a jar when it runs out

b79
- Made some more adjustments, fixing burst fire not working for (quiver)mobs
- Improved Sugar Engine accuracy by 40% (turns out I wasn't aligning the pistons correctly. They created too much vibration as a result.)
- Added the Seed Sweeper
- Added the Ray of Hope
- Modernized the Obsidian Splinter Pistol, Spear Rifle and Wither Rifle. They now use magazines.
  This also has the advantage of increasing their ammo capacity, in addition to making reloading easier.

b78
- Changed some weapon function visibility, for use with Ancient Warfare 2 NPCs

b77
- Added config option to remove disabled weapons from the creative menu as well (By default they're on there, but uncraftable if disabled.)


MAYBE
- Add model to the Powder Knuckles to have them wrap around your hand instead of being held?
- Add a disk launcher, for something that ricochets? (No idea how to go about that yet)
- Add long range single fire homing rocket (Mix lapis into the fuel, also use a beacon for the aiming system, plus eye of ender)
	<Jindra34> (Huh... just thought of something, what would happen if we put ground powder, like say lapis, in with the gunpowder of a rocket...)
- Eggs?
- Add Smoke grenade launcher (particle effects, loads of them), loads 8 shots, each shot being crafted as a container with coal and a fire charge

"this time it comes from the idea for a use for rotten flesh. ... flesh is greasy and filled with decaying rot, it might actually be very flamable.
Add to that that it also contains enough weight to be lobbed a long distance given enough power from a piston tech of some kind,
I predict that when added with netherack you could create a sort of long distance “flame baller” some way."

Models: (Lapis Coil length: 18 barrel, 8 stock. A weapon should have at least 3 width, for solid barrel width)
