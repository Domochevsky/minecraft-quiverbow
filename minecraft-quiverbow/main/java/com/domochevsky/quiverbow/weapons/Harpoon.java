[02:44:19] <Jindra34> (Also what do you think of a harpoon gun? To pull things towards you, as a use of string/wool and wood?)
[02:46:48] <@Domochevsky> (Hm, I could see that playing, same as a grappling gun, but how to make that happen... a critical part is missing there, in the whole "move entity towards 
something")
[02:47:10] <Jindra34> (I figured it just be a simple teleport.)
[02:47:41] <Jindra34> (Grappling gun is really the one where MOVE TO is important)
[02:48:19] <Jindra34> (Also harpoon gun should have a move/teleport exclusion on Big Mobs like the Wither, Ender Dragon and Ghasts)
[02:49:44] <Jindra34> (Then again being able to manipulate where ghasts are would make getting their drops easier... hm...)
[02:49:58] <@Domochevsky> (True... which is not a bad thing, mind you)
[02:50:37] <@Domochevsky> (A harpoon gun of sorts is actually something I could see an ender pearl doing, with the whole "reverse teleport" thing)
[02:51:12] <@Domochevsky> (So using those as ammo to pretend that the target threw this at your feet instead of the other way around ingame)
[02:51:49] <Jindra34> (True, just need a material to act as a 'reflector' for the pearl)
